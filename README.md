# I. Initiative
The program consists of two squares, one will be controlled by the user and one by the AI. The user must try to keep the square away from the enemy square. When the two squares come into contact the user will lose a life. If three lives are lost the game will be over. 

# II. Epics and User Stories

Epics 
- The user will control the user's square with a mouse
- The AI will control the enemy's square and will move towards the user's square
- When the two squares touch each other a life is lost 
- The game will need to take place in a canvas

Non-Functional Requirements
- The colour of the user's square should be green 
- The colour of the Enemy's square should be red 
- There will be a score displayed, the score will go up by one for every second the enemy square doesn't touch the user's square
- The user will have three lives

User Stories
As a player I would like to be able to see my score on the screen. Also when the game is over I would like to see a highscore list, so that I can improve on my own score or try to beat people who played before me.

How We Addressed The Requirements
A plan was set to have a score that the user can see and a highscore list that would come at the end of the game.
